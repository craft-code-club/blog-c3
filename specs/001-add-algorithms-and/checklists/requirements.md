# Specification Quality Checklist: Algorithms and Data Structures Roadmap

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on what users need and why, not how it's built
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- No mentions of React, Next.js, TypeScript, or other implementation technologies

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
- Requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001: "display a dedicated roadmap page" - can verify page exists and loads)
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-001: "2 clicks or fewer", SC-002: "within 3 seconds")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user experience, not technical implementation)
- All three user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identified (empty links, invalid icons, many categories, etc.)
- Scope is bounded to DSA roadmap only (not general roadmap system)
- Assumptions section documents dependencies on existing blog infrastructure

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS
- User Story 1 (P1) provides MVP: viewable roadmap page
- User Story 2 (P2) adds discoverability: navigation integration
- User Story 3 (P3) adds maintainability: configuration file editing
- Each story is independently testable and deliverable
- Requirements map to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-007 navigation link → US2 scenarios)
- Success criteria validate the complete feature (navigation, performance, responsiveness, maintainability)

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths:**
1. Well-prioritized user stories (MVP first, then discoverability, then maintainability)
2. Comprehensive edge cases covering common failure scenarios
3. Clear entity definitions for data structure
4. Measurable, user-focused success criteria
5. Documented assumptions about existing infrastructure

**No issues found** - specification is ready to proceed.
