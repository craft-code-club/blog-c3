# Feature Specification: Algorithms and Data Structures Roadmap

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-algorithms-and`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Algorithms and Data Structures Roadmap page - Issue #24"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View DSA Roadmap Page (Priority: P1)

As a blog reader, I want to access a dedicated Algorithms and Data Structures roadmap page so that I can see a structured learning path with organized topics and materials to guide my studies.

**Why this priority**: This is the core feature - without a viewable roadmap page, the feature provides no value. This is the minimum viable product that delivers immediate value to readers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the roadmap page URL and verifying that the roadmap content displays with all items, categories, titles, descriptions, and links properly rendered in a visually appealing layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the blog homepage, **When** I navigate to the DSA roadmap page, **Then** I see a visually organized roadmap with categories and items displayed in sequential order
2. **Given** I am viewing the roadmap, **When** I look at a roadmap item, **Then** I can see its title, description, and associated links (if any)
3. **Given** I am viewing the roadmap, **When** I scroll through the page, **Then** I can clearly distinguish between different categories and their items
4. **Given** an item has links, **When** I view that item, **Then** I can see each link with its icon, title, and clickable URL
5. **Given** I am viewing the roadmap on mobile, **When** I scroll and interact, **Then** the layout adapts responsively and remains easy to read and navigate

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Roadmap from Main Menu (Priority: P2)

As a blog reader, I want to find a link to the DSA roadmap in the main blog navigation so that I can easily discover and access the roadmap without searching for it.

**Why this priority**: Discoverability is crucial for feature adoption. Without navigation integration, users won't find the roadmap easily. However, the roadmap must exist first (P1) before it can be linked.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining the blog's main navigation menu and clicking the roadmap link to verify it navigates to the correct page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any blog page, **When** I look at the main navigation menu, **Then** I see a clear link or menu item for the DSA roadmap
2. **Given** I see the roadmap navigation link, **When** I click it, **Then** I am taken to the DSA roadmap page
3. **Given** I am on the roadmap page, **When** I look at the navigation, **Then** the roadmap link is highlighted or marked as active
4. **Given** I am using the site on mobile, **When** I open the navigation menu, **Then** I can see and access the roadmap link

### User Story 3 - Configure Roadmap Content (Priority: P3)

As a blog admin, I want to edit the entire DSA roadmap by modifying a single configuration file so that I can easily maintain and update the roadmap content without touching code.

**Why this priority**: Content management is important for long-term maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by modifying the roadmap configuration file (adding/removing items, changing descriptions, updating links) and verifying that changes are reflected on the roadmap page after rebuild.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a blog admin, **When** I open the roadmap configuration file, **Then** I can see a clear, structured format with all roadmap data (categories, items, links)
2. **Given** I edit the configuration file to add a new category, **When** I rebuild the blog, **Then** the new category appears on the roadmap page
3. **Given** I edit the configuration file to add a new item with links, **When** I rebuild the blog, **Then** the new item appears with all its links properly displayed
4. **Given** I edit the configuration file to change an item's description, **When** I rebuild the blog, **Then** the updated description appears on the roadmap page
5. **Given** I edit the configuration file with invalid data, **When** I attempt to build the blog, **Then** I receive clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a roadmap item has no links (optional array is empty)?
- What happens when a link icon is missing or invalid?
- How does the roadmap display when there are many categories (10+)?
- What happens when an item description is very long (200+ characters)?
- How does the page handle a category with only one item vs. many items (20+)?
- What happens when a link URL is broken or invalid?
- How does the roadmap render when there's only one category with one item (minimum data scenario)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a dedicated roadmap page accessible via a unique URL path
- **FR-002**: System MUST render roadmap content organized by categories, displayed in sequential order
- **FR-003**: System MUST display each roadmap item with its title and description
- **FR-004**: System MUST display optional links for each item when they exist, including icon, title, and clickable URL
- **FR-005**: System MUST read all roadmap content from a single configuration file in the content directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST support YAML or Markdown format for the roadmap configuration file (consistent with existing blog content patterns)
- **FR-007**: Navigation menu MUST include a visible link to the DSA roadmap page
- **FR-008**: Roadmap page MUST be responsive and display properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- **FR-009**: Roadmap items MUST be visually distinguishable from one another with clear separation
- **FR-010**: Categories MUST be visually distinguishable with clear headings or section markers
- **FR-011**: Links within items MUST be clickable and open in the same tab (or new tab based on site's link handling conventions)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle items with no links gracefully (display item without link section)
- **FR-013**: Roadmap page MUST follow the blog's existing design system and theme (light/dark mode support)
- **FR-014**: Configuration file MUST be editable without requiring code changes
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate configuration file structure during build and provide clear error messages for invalid data

### Key Entities

- **Roadmap Category**: Represents a thematic grouping of related items (e.g., "Basic Data Structures", "Sorting Algorithms"). Contains: title (required), optional future extensions for description or metadata.

- **Roadmap Item**: Represents a single learning topic or concept within a category. Contains: title (required), description (required, brief text), links (optional array of Link objects), sequential position within category.

- **Link**: Represents a reference or resource for a roadmap item. Contains: icon (required, identifier for visual representation), title (required, display text), url (required, valid URL string).

- **Roadmap Configuration**: The complete roadmap data structure stored in a single file. Contains: array of categories, each containing an array of items, each potentially containing an array of links.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Readers can navigate from the blog homepage to the DSA roadmap page in 2 clicks or fewer
- **SC-002**: Roadmap page loads and renders all content within 3 seconds on a 3G connection
- **SC-003**: Roadmap displays correctly on screens ranging from 320px (mobile) to 1920px (desktop) width
- **SC-004**: Blog admins can add or modify roadmap items by editing a single file without touching any code files
- **SC-005**: 100% of roadmap items with links display all their links as clickable elements with visible icons and titles
- **SC-006**: Roadmap page maintains visual consistency with the rest of the blog (same typography, colors, spacing patterns)
- **SC-007**: Configuration file changes result in updated roadmap content after a standard build process (under 5 minutes)
- **SC-008**: Readers can identify and distinguish between at least 5 different categories on the roadmap page at a glance

### Assumptions

- The roadmap will use the existing blog's static site generation approach (no dynamic backend required)
- Link icons will use existing icon libraries available in the project or can be added as simple SVG assets
- The initial roadmap structure shown in the issue's mermaid diagram will serve as the first version of content
- Roadmap items are intended for sequential learning (displayed in order), not as an interactive graph with connections
- The configuration file will follow similar patterns to existing content files (`_content/posts/`, `_content/events/`)
- Standard Markdown/YAML frontmatter conventions will be used for structured data
- Roadmap content will be in Portuguese (primary blog language)
