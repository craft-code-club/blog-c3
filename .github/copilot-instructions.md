## Core React & Next.js Development Philosophy
- Write clean, maintainable React components using exclusively functional components with hooks
- Never use class components under any circumstances
- Leverage Next.js's file-based routing and server-side rendering capabilities
- Create reusable components following PascalCase naming conventions in the components directory
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript or PropTypes, default values, and use children for flexible component content
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility and utilize global components only when necessary
- Prioritize performance, SEO, responsive design, and accessibility best practices

### Routing, Navigation and State Management
- Use Next.js's app directory routing with dynamic routes for blog posts (`[slug]/page.tsx`) and event pages
- Always use Link component for navigation to maintain optimal performance
- Create clean, SEO-friendly URL structures with graceful 404 handling
- Implement page transitions for smoother user experience using Next.js transition API

## CSS Framework Implementation: Tailwind CSS

### Implementation Strategy
- Plan complete implementation of Tailwind CSS 4.x.x
- Create consistent styling system with Tailwind aligned with community branding
- Build components using Tailwind utility classes
- Create responsive utility classes with Tailwind
- Use Tailwind configuration for theme variables
- Establish consistent UI/UX patterns across all content types
- Design flexible layouts for various content presentation needs

### Tailwind CSS Implementation
- Set up Tailwind CSS with appropriate configuration for Next.js
- Customize Tailwind theme to match the community's brand identity
- Utilize Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode for optimized production builds
- Create custom utility classes when needed for special components
- Use Tailwind's plugin system for extending functionality

### Tailwind CSS v4.0 CSS-First Configuration
- Use CSS-first configuration approach introduced in Tailwind CSS v4.0
- Configure customizations directly in the CSS file where Tailwind is imported
- Eliminate the need for a separate `tailwind.config.js` file
- Use the `@theme` directive to customize colors, spacing, fonts, and other theme values
- Define custom utilities with the `@layer` directive
- Implement responsive variants using `@media` queries in combination with `@layer`
- Take advantage of CSS variables for dynamic theming
- Example:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
  --color-primary: #1d4ed8;
  --color-secondary: #4f46e5;
  --color-accent: #06b6d4;
  --color-surface-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-surface-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-surface-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);
  /* ... */
}

@layer components {
  .card-event {
    /* custom event card styles */
  }

  .card-post {
    /* custom blog post card styles */
  }
}
```
