# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Customize these values for the Craft & Code Club Blog feature.
  Default values are provided based on the project's current stack.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5+ / Node.js (for build time)
**Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router  
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x with CSS-first configuration
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- Content: gray-matter, remark, rehype ecosystem
- UI: next-themes, @tailwindcss/typography
- Highlighting: rehype-highlight
**Storage**: File-based (Markdown/YAML in `_content/` directory) - NO database
**Content Types**: Blog posts (`_content/posts/`), Events (`_content/events/`)
**Build Target**: Static Site Generation (SSG) with `output: "export"`
**Target Platform**: Static HTML/CSS/JS deployable to any CDN/static host
**Performance Goals**: 
- Core Web Vitals "Good" (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)
- Initial load < 3s on 3G
- Main bundle < 200KB
**Constraints**: 
- Must work without server-side runtime
- No API routes or middleware
- Brazilian Portuguese primary language
- Mobile-first responsive design
**Scale/Scope**: Community blog with ~50-200 posts/events, educational content focus

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md` principles:

- [ ] **Content-First**: Does this feature maintain file-based content as source of truth?
- [ ] **No Database**: Does implementation avoid server-side database dependencies?
- [ ] **Static Export**: Can feature work with `output: "export"` configuration?
- [ ] **Performance**: Does implementation meet Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Are WCAG 2.1 AA standards met for all UI components?
- [ ] **Functional Components**: Are all React components functional (no class components)?
- [ ] **Tailwind CSS v4**: Does styling use Tailwind v4 with CSS-first configuration?
- [ ] **SEO Structure**: Are proper meta tags, semantic HTML, and structured data included?
- [ ] **Content Standards**: If adding content features, do they enforce slug conventions and frontmatter schema?

*Document any violations in Complexity Tracking section below with justification.*

**Structure Decision**: This blog uses Next.js App Router with file-based content management. 
Features should extend existing directories rather than creating parallel structures.
All React components go in `src/components/`, all content processing in `src/lib/`,
all routes in `src/app/` following App Router conventions.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
